            I am aspiring software engineer with a unique journey from dentistry to full-stack development. I recently completed the Full Stack Engineer course at General Assembly, where I mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I've built projects like a travel planning web app with OpenAI and a diet app using Google Maps, showcasing my skills in React, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
            My career began in Japan as a dental hygienist and later as a CAD/CAM dental technician in Australia. During the lockdown, I discovered my passion for coding by creating a personal blog site with WordPress. This sparked my desire to pursue a career in software engineering.
            Outside of coding, I stay active in the tech community through online forums and meetups, participate in coding challenges, and balance my day with gym workouts. I also enjoy arranging wedding flowers, a creative hobby from my time as a florist in Melbourne.
            I'm eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team. Letâ€™s connect and explore how I can help build innovative solutions as a software engineer!
